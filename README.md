# How to run the docker image

Let's assume that docker is installed and running in the local machine. Then:

> docker pull ac744/model-training

Run the docker image, binding the docker machine port to the local port
> docker run -p 8888:8888 model-training 

copy paste the URL that appears on the terminal to access the jupyter notebook.
